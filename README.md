# WTWR Weather App

I built a React-powered app using Vite.js that helps users decide what to wear based on the weather. It connects to a weather API to fetch real-time forecasts, then suggests clothing options tailored to the conditions. Whether it’s bundling up for cold temperatures or choosing breathable fabrics for a hot day, my app takes the guesswork out of dressing appropriately. With a clean interface and fast performance, it’s a practical tool for anyone looking to make smarter outfit choices without constantly checking the forecast.
